# Duncan's Postulate — A 4D Hyperfluid Theory of the Universe

This repository contains the initial simulation, theory, and data backing Duncan’s Postulate — a unified theory that models the universe as a hyperfluid, with Psi(μν) representing dark matter and dark energy as vibrational states in spacetime.

## Included
- 📄 `duncans-postulate-paper.docx`
- 🎞️ `simulation.gif`
- 📊 Supporting graphs and images

This theory challenges the current dark matter/energy paradigm and proposes a new framework that matches observed galactic clustering without gravity.
